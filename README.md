#### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

##### Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new - Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

##### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
- User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.
- User Story: I can add a new book.
- User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
- User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.
